Create the following stateful components:

    {Courses} //
                    ✔   This component provides the "Courses" screen by retrieving the 
                        list of courses from the REST API's /api/courses route and rendering a list of courses.

                    ✔   Each course needs to link to its respective "Course Detail" screen. 
                    ✔   This component also renders a link to the "Create Course" screen.

    {CourseDetail} //   
                    ☐   This component provides the "Course Detail" screen by retrieving the detail for a 
                        course from the REST API's /api/courses/:id route and rendering the course.

                    ☐   The component also renders a "Delete Course" button that when clicked should send
                        a DELETE request to the REST API's /api/courses/:id route in order to delete a course.

                    ☐   This component also renders an "Update Course" button for navigating to the "Update Course" screen.

    {UserSignIn} // 
                    ☐   This component provides the "Sign In" screen by rendering a form
                        that allows a user to sign in using their existing account information.

                    ☐   The component also renders a "Sign In" button that when clicked signs in the user
                        and a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).

    {UserSignUp} //
                    ☐   This component provides the "Sign Up" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to sign up by 
                        creating a new account. 

                    ☐   The component also renders a "Sign Up" button that when clicked sends a POST
                        request to the REST API's /api/users route and signs in the user. 

                    ☐   This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user
                        to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).

    {CreateCourse}      
                    ☐   This component provides the "Create Course" screen by rendering a form that allows
                        a user to create a new course.

                    ☐   The component also renders a "Create Course" button that when clicked sends a
                        POST request to the REST API's /api/courses route.

                    ☐   This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user
                        to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).
                        

    {UpdateCourse}      
                    ☐   This component provides the "Update Course" screen by rendering a form that allows
                        a user to update one of their existing courses.

                    ☐   The component also renders an "Update Course" button that when clicked sends a
                        PUT request to the REST API's /api/courses/:id route.

                    ☐   This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the "Course Detail" screen.

Create the following stateless components:

    Header- Displays the top menu bar for the application and includes buttons for signing in and signing up (if there's not an authenticated user) or the user's name and a button for signing out (if there's an authenticated user).
    UserSignOut - This component is a bit of an oddball as it doesn't render any visual elements. Instead, it signs out the authenticated user and redirects the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).
        Pro Tip: Resist the temptation to keep and manage the courses data as global state in the App component. Instead, allow the Courses and CourseDetail components to retrieve their data from the REST API when those components are mounted. Using this approach simplifies the management of the courses data and ensures that the data won't get out of sync with the REST API's persisted data.
